        This portfolio showcases my work at the intersection of instructional design, chemical education, and inclusive learning. From developing Course-based Undergraduate 
        Research Experiences (CUREs) to designing scaffolded video tutorials and educational games, each artifact reflects my passion for turning complex ideas into accessible, 
        engaging learning experiences.
        <br><br>
        My goal is to create learning environments that are thoughtful, rigorous, and fun. I hope this portfolio offers a meaningful glimpse into the instructional values and 
        vision I bring to every learning space.
