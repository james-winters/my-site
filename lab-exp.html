<h3>Kinetic and Thermodynamic Analysis of the Adsorption of Methylene Blue onto Biochar (DOI: <a href="https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jchemed.3c00518">10.1021/acs.jchemed.3c00518</a>)</h3>

    <p>This peer-reviewed article presents a thoughtfully scaffolded laboratory experiment that integrates environmental chemistry with core general chemistry concepts. Designed 
        for undergraduate learners, the activity explores the adsorption of methylene blue onto biochar—a sustainable, low-cost carbon material. Students use UV–vis spectroscopy 
        to monitor the real-time decrease in solution color indirectly corresponding to adsorption, providing immediate visual feedback and reinforcing abstract concepts.
    <br><br>
    The student-facing materials begin with a comprehensive introduction to adsorption and its application in determining kinetic and thermodynamic parameters of a molecular mechanism. 
    To support learners throughout the process, I developed a scaffolded video series that guides them step by step through data analysis and interpretation—demystifying complex calculations 
    and reinforcing conceptual understanding. The instructor-facing materials include practical guidance and pedagogical insights, featuring troubleshooting tips, suggestions for optimizing 
    experimental outcomes, and notes on common pitfalls and sources of error.

<h3>Visualizing Le Châtelier’s Principle through Lead-EDTA Complexometric Titrations (DOI: <a href="https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jchemed.4c00469">10.1021/acs.jchemed.4c00469</a>)</h3>

    <p>This peer-reviewed article originated from a CURE (Course-based Undergraduate Research Experience) curriculum that I designed. As part of the course, students (co-authors) developed and 
        refined their own experimental protocol, which I later adapted into a guided General Chemistry laboratory activity. The resulting experiment enables students to visually 
        investigate Le Châtelier’s Principle through a complexometric titration of lead(II) ions with EDTA. Unlike traditional equilibrium experiments that rely on temperature shifts 
        and UV–vis spectroscopy, this activity uses two interrelated equilibria and a colorimetric indicator to make equilibrium shifts observable in real time.
    <br><br>
    The student-facing materials begin with a clear introduction to complexometric titrations, highlighting the role of EDTA as a chelating agent for metal ions. This foundation is 
    expanded through an in-depth exploration of the interrelated chemical equilibria and their connection to Le Châtelier’s Principle. Students are guided to apply these theoretical 
    concepts throughout the titration process. The post-laboratory questions are designed to deepen understanding by prompting students to interpret specific observations through the 
    lens of equilibrium reactions and Le Châtelier’s Principle. Meanwhile, the instructor notes provide comprehensive explanations of the underlying chemistry, detailing how shifts in 
    equilibrium manifest during the titration sequence.
