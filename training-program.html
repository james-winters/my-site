        This training program was developed to provide targeted support for teaching assistants (TAs) assigned to a Course-based Undergraduate Research Experience (CURE) in General Chemistry 
        II. Unlike traditional laboratory settings, CURE courses emphasize authentic research, where outcomes are unknown to both students and instructors. This presents a unique challenge 
        for TAs, who must guide students through the research process without predefined answers. While conventional TA training often focuses on pedagogy and general instructional strategies, 
        it does not adequately prepare TAs to serve as research mentors.

        <br><br>
        <b>To address this gap, I designed a seven-week, research mentoring program tailored specifically for CURE environments.</b>
        <br><br>

        The training content was informed by the Center for the Improvement of Mentored Experiences in Research (CIMER) <a href="https://cimerproject.org/curricula-overview/">curriculum</a>, 
        incorporating themes and case studies that promote effective, inclusive research mentorship. Aligned with the course’s two-phase structure—“Preparing for Research” and “Authentic 
        Research”—the program was implemented during the first half of the semester to ensure TAs were fully equipped before students entered the discovery phase. Each weekly 45-minute 
        session focused on a distinct aspect of mentoring, such as defining good mentoring traits, how to foster independence, navigating group dynamics, and aligning expectations.
        Each session provided actionable strategies that empowered TAs to support students through open-ended discovery while cultivating a collaborative and curiosity-driven lab environment.

        <br style="clear:both;"><br>

        To assess the effictiveness of the training, I surveyed the TAs at the start and end of the semester. The TAs ranked their self-perceived ability in various mentoring skills on a 7-point Likert scale. 
        <b>Results indicated a consistent increase across all measured skill areas, demonstrating that the training effectively supported TAs in developing reserach mentoring skills.</b>
