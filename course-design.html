<h2 style="text-align:center;">Semester Course Design</h2>
<hr>
<p>My approach follows the ADDIE Model to instructional design. The example below describes my process when I designed a 
    Course-based Undergraduate Research Experience (CURE) in General Chemsitry II Laboratory (DOI: <a href="https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jchemed.4c00519">10.1021/acs.jchemed.4c00519</a>). 
    A CURE brings authentic research into the students' degree requirements so undergraduate research benefits are available to all.</p>

<p style="padding-left: 90px; width:90%;">
    The course was designed primarily for first- and second-year undergraduate students fulfilling a General Chemistry II Laboratory requirement for their degree 
    program. As General Chemistry I was a prerequisite, students were expected to enter the course with foundational chemistry knowledge. Within the structure of 
    weekly 3-hour lab sessions, students engaged in authentic, hands-on research through the Course-based Undergraduate Research Experience. Instruction focused 
    on building fundamental research skills and introducing specialized techniques necessary to investigate the course’s overarching research question. The 
    central research project was carefully selected to align with General Chemistry concepts
</p>

    <span class="addie">D</span> <span style="font-size:18pt;">Design Phase</span>
</p>
<p style="padding-left: 90px; width:90%;">
    Guided by backwards design principles, I began by articulating clear learning objectives for the course. From there, I identified appropriate assessments through which students 
    would demonstrate mastery of those objectives. Then I determined the day-to-day plan and activities that would teach the students the necessary skills for the research and 
    to successfully complete the assessments of the learning objectives. Recognizing that some tasks—such as writing a short research proposal—might be entirely new to students, 
    I proactively identified potential challenges and built in additional scaffolding and resources to support their learning.
</p> 
<p>
    <span class="addie">D</span> <span style="font-size:18pt;">Development Phase</span>
</p>
<p style="padding-left: 90px; width:90%;">
    I developed a comprehensive syllabus that clearly outlined course expectations and learning objectives. To support daily instruction, I designed a suite of instructional 
    materials, including PowerPoint presentations, experimental protocols, and formative assessments. For more complex assessments, I produced student-friendly guides to scaffold 
    the learning process, along with data analysis tutorial videos to walk students through interpreting their results. Additionally, I created detailed instructor-facing resources 
    to facilitate consistent implementation and support teaching efficacy.

<p>
    <span class="addie">I</span> <span style="font-size:18pt;">Implementation Phase</span>
</p>
<p style="padding-left: 90px; width:90%;">
    Before the semester began, I provided instructors with all course materials, including pre-built modules integrated into the Canvas LMS and comprehensive instructor-facing guides. 
    I also played an active role in onboarding the instructional team—walking them through the curriculum design, clarifying pedagogical intentions behind each component, and supporting 
    them in confidently implementing the course as designed.
</p>
<p>
    <span class="addie">E</span> <span style="font-size:18pt;">Evaluation Phase</span>
</p>
<p style="padding-left: 90px; width:90%;">
    Throughout the course development and design, I regularly sought feedback from colleagues to refine my design of the course. Upon launching the course, I administered Google Form 
    surveys to evalute the course from the students' perspective. In additional to formal feedback, the instructors and I had informal conversations with the students to better understand
    their experiences and indentify opportunities for enhancing the course. At the end of the semester, the instructors and I had a debrief meeting to reflect on the course’s outcomes and 
    collaboratively outline potential revisions for future iterations.
